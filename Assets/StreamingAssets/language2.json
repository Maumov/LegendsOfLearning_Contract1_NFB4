The gems coordinates are on the left side of the screen, I will try the yellow one.","mapaTutorial_2":"It shows me a red and a blue location, let's try with the red one.","mapaTutorial_3":"In this one I have to multiply 1/2 times 1/4, the answer is 1/8.","mapaTutorial_4":"The blue multiplication is 3/5 times 1/2, the answer is 3/10.","mapaTutorial_5":"The legend says that the amount of red and blue lines shown on the map is the same as the denominator obtained from the multiplication.","mapaTutorial_6":"In this case the red location is 1/8. That means I have to put 8 red lines with the buttons at the bottom of the screen.","mapaTutorial_7":"Ok, now the 10 blue lines with the other buttons.","mapaTutorial_8":"Great! I have the right amount of lines, now I just have to click in the intersection between the first red line and the third blue line.","mapaTutorial_9":"The yellow gem location is revealed, I will go check it.","mapaTutorial_10":"To close the map I can press the 'M' key again or click on the 'X' on the top right corner.","puertaTutorial_1":"This door is blocking my way to the gem. I have to open it.","puertaTutorial_2":"The mecanism will open when I put the right answer and click the 3 buttons.","puertaTutorial_3":"Let's try with the answer of any operation and click on the button with the red circle to check.","puertaTutorialGood":"That was the right answer! The answers seems to be related, let's try the same one with the other buttons.","puertaTutorialBad":"That's not quite the answer, let's try again.","puertaTutorial_Final":"I knew it, the answers were related, I can see a division as a multiplication and as a fraction.","cofre_1":"Finally the first gem. But it is inside the chest, let's open it.","modulo1Tutorial_1":"I can solve this writting a value on the purple fraction's numerator.","modulo1Tutorial_2":"This vault have the same amount of stamps as the red fraction's denominator.","modulo1Tutorial_3":"Inside of every red piece there are blue stamps and it is the same amount as the blue fraction's denominator.","modulo1Tutorial_4":"This means that if I cut a piece of the lock according to the red fraction and then stamp it according to the blue fraction.","modulo1Tutorial_5":"I will find how to express the fraction of a fraction as a fraction times a fraction. With a look on the purple fraction's denominator I can see is the result of multiply the red and blue fraction's denominator.","modulo1Tutorial_6":"I will find the answer multiplying the red and blue fraction's numerators. Let's check the answer clicking the button with the red circle.","modulo2Tutorial_1":"This part is very similar to the earlier one, I will use the same idea to answer it, let's put a value clicking the button with the red circle in it.","modulo12Tutorial_Good":"That was the right answer. Great!","modulo12Tutorial_Bad":"It looks like is not the answer of multiplying numerators, let's try again.","modulo3Tutorial_1":"This puzzle looks easy, blue squares on top, and red squares on left, with purple squares on the middle.","modulo3Tutorial_2":" I have to put the same amount of squares as the red squares multiplying by the blue squares. Let's do it clicking on the buttons at the bottom of the screen.","modulo3Tutorial_3":"Ok, looks like I have the same amount as one side, let's get the right amount of squares on the other side.","modulo3Tutorial_4":"With the perfect amount of squares, Let's turn on some squares clicking on them.","modulo3Tutorial_5":"Let's turn on the purple squares that are under the turned on blue squares and the side of the turned on red squares","modulo3Tutorial_Good":"The amount of squares that I should turn on is the same as the multiplication of the blue and red turned on squares.","modulo3Tutorial_Bad":"It does not seem like the amount of right turned on squares, maybe it is the multiplication of the red and blue turned on squares.","cofreFinished":"I have opened the chest! The gem is free, I am missing just 3 more and the treasure door will open.","lastChestOpen":"I have found the last gem and a sudden earthquake happned. I will go check the treasure door.","treasureFinded":"Finally found the fraction treasure!"}}
